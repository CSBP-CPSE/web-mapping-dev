# DEIL Web Mapping Development:

This repository contains web mapping projects being developed at the Data Exploration and Integration Lab (DEIL), at the Centre for Special Business Projects (CSBP), Statistics Canada.

Currently three web mapping projects are developed in this repository:

1. [The Linkable Open Data Environment (LODE) Viewer](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2020014-eng.htm)
2. The Population Viewer
3. [The Proximity Measures Data Viewer](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2020011-eng.htm)

Note: This repository has been archived, and is now sub-divided into separate libraries. The core web-mapping logic has been moved to the [web-mapping-components library](https://github.com/CSBP-CPSE/web-mapping-components), and the code for each application viewer specific application has been placed in their own repositories respectfully (e.g. [lode-viewer](https://github.com/CSBP-CPSE/lode-viewer)).
